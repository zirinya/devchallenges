                        Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a buttery
                                            graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water
                                            bath.</p>

                <ol class="check_list_1">
                    <li>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
                    <li>Make the crust: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a
                                                medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all
                                                together in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and
                                                slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I
                                                use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove
                                                from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around
                                                the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the
                                                cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the
                                                mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon
                                                juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after
                                                each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop
                                                mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid
                                                over-mixing the batter as best you can.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your
                                                roasting pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot
                                                water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the
                                                cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even
                                                layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the
                                                pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the
                                                hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)</li>
                    <li>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center
                                                of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open
                                                the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down
                                                for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room
                                                temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
                    <li>Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the
                                                rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife
                                                clean and dip into warm water between each slice.</li>
                    <li>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator
                                                for up to 5 days.</li>
